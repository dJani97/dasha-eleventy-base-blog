# Case Study - CinemaPlanet

Movie ticketing app for a local cinema.

### **Timeline**:

### Deliverable:

1 month

Dedicated Mobile App

### **Responsibilities & Methods**:

**Research**: interviews (qualitative data), usability tests.

**Research synthesis:** personas, empathy maps, user stories, affinity diagram (card sorting), user journey map.

**UX Design**: storyboards, sketching, wireframing, prototyping

**UI Design** + Iterations

### Problem:

- The local cinema's website doesn't have a registration option, which makes the checkout process repetitive and time-consuming for a returning user.
- People who buy tickets in the cinema frequently have to stand in a long queue and then in another to purchase movie snacks or/and drinks.

### User goal:

An app to buy and book movie tickets easily and pre-order snacks to avoid waiting in the cinema queues.

### User Research - Interviews

I interviewed potential users to learn about their process of booking and buying movie tickets and to identify their frustrations.

I pined downed participant’s responses to the three main pain points that a common for the majority of users:

- lack of sign-up/in option
- need to book tickets in advance (to get the best seats, plan time)
- want to read a movie critique and reviews

### Who am I designing for:

### Usability Testing

Round 1

**✅** Todo: image Interview cards

I conducted usability testing sessions with five participants, and following the card sorting method, I discovered common themes amongst users. Then, I turned the themes into insights and updated the prototype:

**✅** Todo: image updates based on insights

### **Refining the Design (Hi-Fidelity Prototype)**

Todo: same as last image in the design iteration based on the insights, but colorful

### Usability Testing

Round 2

I performed another round of the usability study to finalize the design.

### **✅** Final Result:

### I Learned:

- the importance of research and its significant impact on the design process. By conducting interviews and usability tests, I could get insights I did not consider myself.
- how to organize my Figma files and projects, which significantly saves time while working on the designs.

### If I Could Go Back in Time:

- I would first decide what device type to design for. Now I see that the responsive web is the best point to start from, as it is a redesign of the existing website, and downloading the app is not what users want when they go to the cinema once, twice a month, or less.

### Next steps:

- scale design to a bigger screen, in other words, to continue the bottom-top approach since I started with it.
- design ‘Tickets’ and ‘Offers’ screens.
- conduct a series of usability tests to polish designs.
